A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that arranges a list of elements in a specific order, typically in increasing or decreasing order. There are many different sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency, space complexity, and other factors.

Here are a few common sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort: Bubble sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).

Insertion Sort: Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time by inserting each unsorted element into its proper place in the sorted array. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).

Selection Sort: Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and puts it at the beginning. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).

Merge Sort: Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of O(nlogn).

Quick Sort: Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that partitions the input array into two parts around a pivot element, sorts the parts recursively, and then combines the sorted parts. It has a time complexity of O(nlogn) in the average case, but can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case.

Heap Sort: Heap sort builds a binary heap from the input array and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and places it at the end of the array. It has a time complexity of O(nlogn).
